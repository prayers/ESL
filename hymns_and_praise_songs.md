# Lyrics of Praise Songs
## Doxology
    Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow
    Praise Him, all creatures here below
    Praise Him above, ye heavenly host
    Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
    
    Amen, amen, amen, amen
## You Raise me up
    When I am down, and, oh, my soul, so weary
    When troubles come, and my heart burdened be
    Then, I am still and wait here in the silence
    Until you come and sit awhile with me
    
    You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
    You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
    I am strong when I am on your shoulders
    You raise me up to more than I can be
    
    You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
    You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
    I am strong when I am on your shoulders
    You raise me up to more than I can be
    
    You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
    You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
    I am strong when I am on your shoulders
    You raise me up to more than I can be
    
    You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
    You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
    I am strong when I am on your shoulders
    You raise me up to more than I can be
    
    You raise me up to more than I can be
## Amzing Grace
    Amazing Grace, How sweet the sound
    That saved a wretch like me
    I once was lost, but now am found
    T'was blind but now I see
    
    T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
    And Grace, my fears relieved
    How precious did that grace appear
    The hour I first believed
    
    Through many dangers, toils and snares
    We have already come.
    T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
    And grace will lead us home,
    And grace will lead us home
    
    Amazing grace, Howe Sweet the sound
    That saved a wretch like me
    I once was lost but now am found
    T'was blind but now I see
    
    Was blind, but now I see.
